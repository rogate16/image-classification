\#\# What's Next

 

The model was built with roughly 1500 images using data from
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ilhamfp31/kue-indonesia). This is a small
dataset for computer vision task and thus the accuracy. I might be updating this
repository if I could find more data which can provide higher accuracy.
